The game was released in March 2018 and has since become one of the most popular mobile games in the world.The development of PUBG Mobile took just 4 months to be completed, as multiple teams from around the world contributing to the project. The project began with the original PC and console version of the game, which was developed by Brendan Greene (known as PlayerUnknown) and released in 2017. Following the success of the that particular game, Tencent Games began their own development project with PUBG Studios for the mobile version. In doing so, they had to create an evolution of the Unreal Engine 4, and was optimized to suit the mobile platform, with a focus on smoother performance and enhanced graphics.</p>
